This Readme will just have general info. For usage and more info read the readme in the respective project folder :)

# Functional Wrappers and Helpers

This includes functional types that help building more robust and provable functions. The usage is pretty
self explanatory from the XML documentations of the actual functions and types.

### Error handling
I also prefer to use `Result` or `Maybe` to propagate errors instead of throwing exceptions everytime. Exceptions in my mind are for exceptional cases, when shit hits the fan. Not when some API call might return an error that it often does. For that i prefer Go's error handling in just returning an error object that can be handled. 


# Database Fundamental Functions

This mainly includes my implementation of the DB wrapper and transactor allowing you 
to easily write repositories and add normal but also atomic queries.

# Network Fundamental Functions

This is just a neat HttpClient wrapper that provides some easy to use helper functions 
to easily create requests and have them already mapped etc.

This library also makes use of the lightweight Result wrapper for a better error handling
experience without try catch :)

These functions are built upon eachother. The first function in the list below is the highest level and each function above calls the one below, just as a FYI.
